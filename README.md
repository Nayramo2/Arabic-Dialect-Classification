# Arabic-Dialect-Classification
This repository contains the code and resources for a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system designed to predict Arabic dialects from text. The system employs TF-IDF vectorization and a variety of classifiers including Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and XGBoost to analyze and predict the dialect of Arabic text inputs.

**Project Overview:**
Arabic dialects vary significantly across different regions, presenting unique challenges in text analysis and comprehension. This project addresses these challenges by developing a model that can accurately predict the dialect based on textual inputs, enhancing the understanding of regional linguistic variations.

**Features:**
Text Normalization: Standardizes and normalizes the input text, handling the diverse linguistic features of Arabic.
TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts text data into a numerical format suitable for model training and prediction.
Multiple Classifier Support: Utilizes Naive Bayes, SVM, and XGBoost classifiers to ensure robust and accurate dialect predictions.
Real-time Prediction: Supports real-time analysis and prediction of Arabic dialects through a web interface.
